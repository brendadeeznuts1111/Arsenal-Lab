# 🔐 Bun System Gate – Bootstrapper Ultima

> FAANG-grade patch governance for Bun repositories – **30 seconds, one curl**.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Bootstrap governance in any Bun repo
curl -sSL https://bun.sh/gate | bash
```

Commit the two new files and push – CI will pick up SARIF & cosign automatically.

## 📦 What You Get

- ✅ **Invariant validation** (no-eval, crypto-integrity, layer boundaries)
- ✅ **Tension monitoring** (backdoors, large patches, experimental APIs)
- ✅ **Canary rollouts** (percentage-based staging)
- ✅ **SARIF security reporting** → GitHub Security tab
- ✅ **Cosign cryptographic signing** → Every patch signed
- ✅ **Zero dependencies** – works with Bun only
