```toml
# Organization-wide Bun Configuration
# Deployed: $(date)

[install.security]
scanner = "https://arsenal-lab.yourcompany.com/packages/arsenal-security-scanner/src/index.ts"

[arsenal.scanner]
api_url = "https://arsenal-lab.yourcompany.com"
cache_ttl = 3600
fail_open = true
block_level = "high"
verbose = false

# Organization-specific settings
[organization]
name = "Your Company Name"
security_policy = "strict"
performance_requirements = "bun-1.3-plus"
```

#!/bin/bash
# setup-dev-environment.sh

echo "🚀 Setting up Bun System Gate for $(whoami)"

# Install Bun if not present
if ! command -v bun &> /dev/null; then
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
fi

# Configure Bun System Gate
mkdir -p ~/.bun
cat > ~/.bun/bunfig.toml << EOF
[install.security]
scanner = "https://arsenal-lab.yourcompany.com/packages/arsenal-security-scanner/src/index.ts"

[arsenal.scanner]
api_url = "https://arsenal-lab.yourcompany.com"
cache_ttl = 3600
fail_open = true
block_level = "high"
verbose = false
EOF

echo "✅ Bun System Gate configured!"
echo "🔒 Security scanner active for all bun install operations"
```

#### **Step 2.3: Configure IDE Integration**

Create organization-wide documentation:

```markdown
# 🔒 Bun System Gate - Developer Guide

## What is Bun System Gate?

Bun System Gate is your organization's enterprise governance system that automatically ensures all code meets FAANG-grade security and performance standards.

## How It Works

### 🔍 Automatic Security Scanning
Every `bun install` is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities:
```bash
$ bun add vulnerable-package@1.0.0
🔒 Arsenal Security Scanner: Found 1 vulnerability issue(s)
FATAL: vulnerable-package - Critical security vulnerability
Installation aborted due to fatal security advisories
```

### ⚡ Performance Enforcement
Code patterns are automatically optimized for Bun 1.3+ performance.

### 🏗️ Architecture Validation
Common anti-patterns are blocked before they reach production.

## Getting Started

1. **Run the onboarding script:**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://arsenal-lab.yourcompany.com/setup-dev | bash
   ```

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   bun run gate:verify
   # Should show: ✅ All systems operational
   ```

3. **Test security scanning:**
   ```bash
   bun add lodash@4.17.11  # Should be blocked
   bun add lodash@4.17.21  # Should work
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Security scanner not found"
```bash
# Re-run onboarding
curl -fsSL https://arsenal-lab.yourcompany.com/setup-dev | bash
```

### "Gate verification failed"
```bash
# Check your bunfig.toml
cat ~/.bun/bunfig.toml
```

### "Performance hints not showing"
```bash
# Enable in Cursor/VS Code settings
"bun.systemGate.performanceHints": true
```
