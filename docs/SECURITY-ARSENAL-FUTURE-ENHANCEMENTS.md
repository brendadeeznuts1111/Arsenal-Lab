**Status:** Ideas for Future Development
**Version:** 1.4.0+

---

## 🔮 Potential Future Enhancements

These features were identified during development but not implemented. They could be added in future versions based on user demand and project priorities.

---

## 1. 🛡️ Bun Security Scanner API Integration

**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Medium
**Bun Version:** 1.3+

### Overview
Bun v1.3+ includes a built-in Security Scanner API that allows custom security scanners to be integrated directly into the package manager. This could provide real-time security scanning during `bun install` and `bun add` operations.

### Reference Documentation
- [Bun Security Scanner API](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/bunfig#install-security-scanner)
- [Official Scanner Template](https://github.com/oven-sh/security-scanner-template)

### Implementation Ideas

#### A. Custom Scanner Integration
Create a custom Bun security scanner that integrates with Arsenal Lab:

```toml
# bunfig.toml
[install.security]
scanner = "@bun/arsenal-security-scanner"
```

**Features:**
- Scan packages before installation
- Display warnings in Arsenal Lab UI
- Block installation of critical vulnerabilities
- Store scan results in Arsenal Lab history
- Real-time notifications during `bun add`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// packages/arsenal-security-scanner/index.ts
export default {
  async scan(packages: Package[]): Promise<SecurityResult> {
    // Custom scanning logic
    // Could integrate with existing Arsenal Lab audit system
    return {
      level: 'fatal' | 'warn',
      message: 'Security issue detected',
      vulnerabilities: [...]
    };
  }
};
```

#### B. Pre-built Scanner Support
Support popular security scanners out-of-the-box:

```typescript
// components/SecurityArsenal/utils/scannerIntegration.ts
const SUPPORTED_SCANNERS = {
  '@socket.dev/bun-scanner': {
    name: 'Socket Security',
    docs: 'https://socket.dev/bun'
  },
  '@snyk/bun-scanner': {
    name: 'Snyk',
    docs: 'https://snyk.io'
  }
  // Add more as they become available
};
```

#### C. Arsenal Lab Scanner Registry UI
Add a UI panel for managing security scanners:

**Features:**
- Browse available scanners
- Install scanner with one click
- Configure scanner settings
- View scanner status and logs
- Enable/disable scanners

**Mockup:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Security Scanners                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ✅ @bun/arsenal-scanner     [Configure] │
│ ⭕ @socket.dev/bun-scanner  [Install]   │
│ ⭕ @snyk/bun-scanner        [Install]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Benefits
