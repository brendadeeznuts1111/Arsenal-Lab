# 🩹 Bun Patch Workflows - Enterprise Package Management

## Overview

Bun's `patch` command provides **persistent, git-friendly patching** of node_modules packages. Unlike temporary workarounds, patches created with `bun patch` are:

- **Persistent**: Survive reinstalls and machine changes
- **Git-friendly**: Stored as .patch files that can be committed
- **Shareable**: Distribute patches across teams and projects
- **Safe**: Preserves Bun's Global Cache integrity

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Package for Patching
```bash
# Prepare a package for editing
bun patch react

# Or specify exact version
bun patch react@18.2.0
```

### 2. Edit the Package
```bash
# Edit files directly in node_modules/
code node_modules/react/index.js

# Make your changes...
```

### 3. Commit the Patch
```bash
# Generate and apply the patch
bun patch --commit react

# Custom patches directory
bun patch --commit react --patches-dir=mypatches

# pnpm compatibility alias
bun patch-commit react
```

**What happens during commit:**
1. **🔍 Analyzes changes** - Creates diff between original and modified package
2. **📄 Generates .patch file** - Stores patch in patches/ directory (or custom --patches-dir)
3. **📦 Updates package.json** - Adds "patchedDependencies" section tracking the patch
4. **🔒 Updates lockfile** - Modifies bun.lockb to reference the patched package
5. **🚀 Applies immediately** - Current installation starts using the patched version
6. **🔄 Auto-applies on install** - Future `bun install` commands automatically apply the patch

**Files affected:**
- `patches/react+18.2.0.patch` - The actual patch file (git-friendly)
- `package.json` - Added "patchedDependencies" section
- `bun.lockb` - Updated to reference patched package version

**Advanced CLI Options:**
For power users, Bun patch supports many additional options for specialized use cases. See the [complete CLI reference](https://bun.com/docs/pm/cli/patch#cli-usage) for options like:
- Network configuration (`--registry`, `--network-concurrency`)
- Platform targeting (`--cpu`, `--os`)
- Installation control (`--backend`, `--dry-run`, `--force`)
- Caching and performance (`--cache-dir`, `--concurrent-scripts`)
- And many more advanced configuration options

## 📋 Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Package
```bash
bun patch <package>[@version]
```
**What it does:**
- Creates fresh copy in `node_modules/` (no cache symlinks)
- Makes it safe to edit package files directly
- Preserves Global Cache integrity
- Prepares for diff generation

### Step 2: Edit Package
**Important:** Only edit files after running `bun patch <pkg>`!

```bash
# Safe to edit after preparation
node_modules/react/
├── index.js          # ✅ Safe to edit
├── package.json      # ✅ Safe to edit
└── ...               # ✅ Safe to edit
```

**What NOT to do:**
```bash
# ❌ DON'T edit without preparation
code node_modules/lodash/
# This affects Global Cache globally!
```

### Step 3: Commit Patch
```bash
bun patch --commit <package> [--patches-dir=<dir>]
```

**Creates:**
- `.patch` file in `patches/` directory
- Updates `package.json` with `"patchedDependencies"`
- Links patch to specific package version
- Makes patch persistent across installs

## 📁 File Structure

```
project/
├── patches/
│   └── react+18.2.0.patch    # Generated patch file
├── package.json              # Updated with patchedDependencies
└── bun.lockb                 # Tracks patched packages
```

### package.json Changes
```json
{
  "patchedDependencies": {
    "react@18.2.0": "patches/react+18.2.0.patch"
  }
}
```

### Patch File Format
```diff
diff --git a/index.js b/index.js
index 1234567..abcdef0 100644
--- a/index.js
+++ b/index.js
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 // React main entry point
-export const version = '18.2.0';
+export const version = '18.2.0-patched';
```

## 🎯 Enterprise Use Cases

### 1. Hotfix Critical Bugs
```bash
# Security vulnerability in production dependency
bun patch axios
# Edit axios to add security headers
bun patch --commit axios
# Deploy with patched, secure version
```

### 2. Feature Backports
```bash
# Need feature from newer version in older stable
bun patch typescript@4.9.5
# Add backported feature
bun patch --commit typescript@4.9.5
```

### 3. Environment-Specific Fixes
```bash
# Windows-specific path handling fix
bun patch path-to-regexp
# Add Windows path normalization
bun patch --commit path-to-regexp
```

### 4. Legacy Package Support
```bash
# Old package needs Node.js 16+ API
bun patch legacy-package
# Add compatibility layer
bun patch --commit legacy-package
```

## 🏗️ Advanced Configuration

### Custom Patches Directory
```bash
# Use custom patches directory
bun patch --commit react --patches-dir=vendor/patches

# Result:
vendor/patches/react+18.2.0.patch
```

### Multiple Package Versions
```bash
# Different patches for different versions
bun patch react@17.0.2  # Creates one patch
bun patch react@18.2.0  # Creates different patch

# Both can coexist
```

### Workspace Monorepo Patching
```json
// Root package.json
{
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  "patchedDependencies": {
    "shared-lib@1.0.0": "patches/shared-lib+1.0.0.patch"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Integration Examples

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: bun install

- name: Apply patches
  run: bun patch  # Applies all patches from package.json

- name: Run tests
  run: bun test
```

### Docker Build
```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:latest

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install  # Automatically applies patches

COPY . .
RUN bun run build
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo>
bun install  # Patches applied automatically

# Work with patched packages
bun run dev
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices

### 1. Version Pinning
```json
{
  "patchedDependencies": {
    "react@18.2.0": "patches/react+18.2.0.patch"  // Pin exact version
  }
}
```

### 2. Clear Commit Messages
```bash
git add patches/react+18.2.0.patch
git commit -m "fix: patch React for Windows path handling

- Add Windows-specific path normalization
- Fixes issue with dynamic imports on Windows
- Applied via bun patch --commit react@18.2.0"
```

### 3. Documentation
```markdown
# Patches

## react@18.2.0.patch
**Purpose:** Windows path handling fix
**Issue:** Dynamic imports fail on Windows
**Impact:** Affects development on Windows machines
**Test:** Verified with Windows CI runner
```

### 4. Testing Patches
```bash
# Test patch before committing
bun patch react
# Edit and test changes
npm test  # or bun test

# If tests pass, commit
bun patch --commit react
```

### 5. Patch Maintenance
```bash
# Update patch for new package version
bun patch react@18.2.1  # Prepare new version
# Apply same changes
bun patch --commit react@18.2.1  # New patch file

# Update package.json
{
  "patchedDependencies": {
    "react@18.2.1": "patches/react+18.2.1.patch"  // Updated
  }
}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module" after patching
```bash
# Reinstall to apply patches
rm -rf node_modules
bun install
```

### Patch not applying
```bash
# Check package.json patchedDependencies
cat package.json | grep patchedDependencies

# Verify patch file exists
ls -la patches/

# Reapply patches
bun install --force
```

### Conflicts with package updates
```bash
# Option 1: Update patch for new version
bun patch package@new-version
# Reapply changes
bun patch --commit package@new-version

# Option 2: Temporarily disable patch
# Remove from patchedDependencies in package.json
bun install
```

### Global Cache issues
```bash
# Clear Global Cache (removes all cached packages)
bun pm cache rm

# Reinstall everything fresh
rm -rf node_modules
bun install
```
