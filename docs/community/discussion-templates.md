## 🙏 Q&A Template

**Title:** How do I optimize Bun.build() for production deployments?

**Category:** Q&A

**Content:**
```
Hi everyone! 👋

I'm trying to optimize my Bun.build() configuration for production deployments. Currently, I'm using:

```javascript
await Bun.build({
  entrypoints: ['./src/index.ts'],
  outdir: './dist',
  minify: true,
  sourcemap: 'linked'
});
```

But I'm seeing large bundle sizes and slow build times. Any tips for:

1. **Reducing bundle size** - What minification options should I use?
2. **Faster builds** - Any build performance optimizations?
3. **Better code splitting** - How to implement proper chunking?
4. **Production optimizations** - What other flags should I consider?

My project structure:
```
src/
├── index.ts (main entry)
├── components/
├── utils/
└── styles/
```

Thanks for any advice! 🙏
```

## 💡 Feature Request Template

**Title:** Add Support for Web Workers in Performance Arsenal

**Category:** Ideas

**Content:**
```
## Feature Request: Web Workers Support

### Problem
Currently, the Performance Arsenal tests run in the main thread, which can impact accuracy when measuring performance of CPU-intensive operations. Web Workers would allow isolated testing environments.

### Proposed Solution
Add a new benchmark category specifically for Web Worker performance testing:

```typescript
// Example API
const workerBenchmark = createWorkerBenchmark({
  name: 'fibonacci-worker',
  workerScript: './workers/fibonacci.worker.ts',
  testData: { n: 40 },
  iterations: 10
});
```

### Benefits
- **Accurate measurements** - No main thread interference
- **Real-world testing** - Matches actual Web Worker usage patterns
- **Performance isolation** - Dedicated CPU cores for testing
- **Scalability testing** - Test worker pool performance

### Implementation Ideas
1. Worker manager component for spawning/monitoring workers
2. Pre-built worker templates for common benchmarks
3. Worker communication protocol for test coordination
4. Performance metrics aggregation across workers

### Related Issues
- Would complement existing crypto and memory benchmarks
- Could integrate with the existing benchmark framework
- Supports Bun's native Web Worker implementation

What do you think? Would this be valuable for your use cases?

## 🙌 Show and Tell Template

**Title:** From 2.3s to 0.8s: My Bun Migration Success Story

**Category:** Show and Tell

**Content:**
```
# My Bun Migration Journey 🚀

## Background
I was running a Node.js API server with Express, handling ~500 req/sec with response times around 2.3 seconds. Decided to try Bun for the performance improvements everyone talks about.

## Migration Process

### Day 1: Initial Setup
```bash
# Started with a simple conversion
bun create my-app
# Migrated basic Express routes to Bun.serve()
```

### Day 2: Performance Arsenal Testing
Used Arsenal Lab to benchmark the migration:

```
Node.js (Express):
- Cold start: 2.3s
- Memory usage: 45MB
- CPU usage: 12%

Bun (Native):
- Cold start: 0.8s (65% improvement!)
- Memory usage: 32MB (29% reduction)
- CPU usage: 8%
```

### Day 3: Database Optimization
Switched from `pg` to Bun's native SQLite for caching layer:

```typescript
// Before: pg client
const client = new pg.Client();
await client.connect();

// After: Bun SQLite
const db = new Database(':memory:');
const cache = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM cache WHERE key = ?');
```

## Results

### Performance Improvements
- **Response time**: 2.3s → 0.8s (65% faster)
- **Memory usage**: 45MB → 32MB (29% less)
- **CPU usage**: 12% → 8% (33% reduction)
- **Startup time**: 5s → 1.2s (76% faster)

### Code Simplifications
- Removed 15 dependencies (express, pg, dotenv, etc.)
- 40% less code in package.json
- Native TypeScript support without ts-node
- Built-in testing with `bun test`

## Challenges Faced
1. **SQLite migration** - Had to redesign caching strategy
2. **Environment variables** - Bun.env works differently
3. **File operations** - Learned Bun's native file APIs

## Lessons Learned
1. **Start small** - Migrate one service at a time
2. **Use Arsenal Lab** - Essential for performance validation
3. **Embrace Bun's philosophy** - Less dependencies = better performance
4. **Test thoroughly** - Performance improvements can introduce bugs

## Current Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun 1.3.x
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary) + SQLite (cache)
- **API**: Bun.serve() native
- **Testing**: Bun test framework
- **Monitoring**: Arsenal Lab performance metrics

## What's Next
- Implementing Web Workers for heavy computations
- Setting up Bun.build() for production deployments
- Exploring Bun's plugin system

Would love to hear about your Bun migration experiences! What challenges did you face? 🎉
