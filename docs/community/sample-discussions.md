### Build Optimization
**Title:** üéØ Advanced Bun.build() Configurations: Share Your Secrets
```
Thread for sharing optimized Bun.build() configurations for different use cases.

**My Production Config:**
```javascript
await Bun.build({
  entrypoints: ['./src/index.ts'],
  outdir: './dist',
  target: 'bun',
  format: 'esm',
  minify: {
    whitespace: true,
    syntax: true,
    identifiers: false // Keep for debugging
  },
  sourcemap: 'external',
  splitting: true,
  external: ['@prisma/client', 'redis'],
  define: {
    'process.env.NODE_ENV': '"production"',
    '__DEV__': 'false'
  }
});
```

**Results:**
- Bundle size: 245KB ‚Üí 180KB (26% reduction)
- Build time: 3.2s ‚Üí 1.8s (44% faster)
- Gzip size: 45KB ‚Üí 38KB

What's your go-to build configuration? Any special optimizations for specific use cases?
```

### Database Performance
**Title:** üöÄ SQLite vs PostgreSQL vs Redis: When to Use What?
```
With Bun supporting multiple databases natively, when do you choose each option?

**My Use Cases:**

1. **SQLite (Bun native)**
   - User preferences and settings
   - Session storage
   - Cache layers for small apps
   - Development and testing databases

2. **PostgreSQL**
   - Production applications
   - Complex queries and relationships
   - High concurrency requirements
   - Data persistence and integrity

3. **Redis**
   - Session management
   - Real-time features (chat, notifications)
   - Rate limiting and caching
   - Pub/sub messaging

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- SQLite writes: ~50,000 ops/sec
- Redis gets: ~100,000 ops/sec
- PostgreSQL complex queries: ~2,000 ops/sec

What's your database strategy? Any surprising discoveries about performance trade-offs?
```

### Package Management Workflows
**Title:** üîÑ Enterprise Monorepo: Catalog Dependencies & Workspace Management
```
Managing a 100+ package enterprise monorepo with Bun PM - here's my optimization journey!

**Challenge:**
- 120 packages across 8 workspaces
- `bun install` taking 8+ minutes
- Dependency drift between workspaces
- Security audit timeouts
- Complex catalog management

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Catalog Dependencies Strategy:**
```json
{
  "catalog": {
    "react": "^19.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.6.0",
    "eslint": "^9.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^22.0.0"
  }
}
```
- Centralized version management for shared deps
- Automatic consistency across workspaces
- Reduced bundle size through deduplication

2. **Workspace Optimization:**
```bash
# Selective installation for development
bun install --filter="./packages/ui"

# Parallel workspace operations
bun pm update --recursive --concurrent

# Targeted security audits
bun pm audit --filter="./apps/api"
```

3. **CI/CD Integration:**
```yaml
- name: Install Dependencies
  run: bun install --frozen-lockfile

- name: Security Audit
  run: bun pm audit --severity=high --json > audit.json

- name: Update Check
  run: bun pm outdated --filter="./packages/*" || true
```

**Results:**
- **Install time**: 8 minutes ‚Üí 2.5 minutes (69% improvement)
- **Security coverage**: 100% of packages now audited regularly
- **Update management**: Zero dependency drift incidents
- **Bundle size**: 15% reduction through catalog optimization

**Key Learnings:**
1. **Catalog for shared deps** - Essential for large monorepos
2. **Workspace filtering** - Dramatically speeds up development
3. **Parallel operations** - Use `--concurrent` for multi-workspace tasks
4. **Regular audits** - Catch security issues before they hit production

```

**Immediate Response (T-0):**
1. **Impact Assessment**: Identified affected API endpoints
2. **Traffic Analysis**: 45% of requests hit vulnerable paths
3. **Business Impact**: Potential data exfiltration risk

**Short-term Mitigation (T+2 hours):**
```typescript
// Temporary axios replacement
const safeFetch = (url: string, options?: RequestInit) => {
  // Validate URL against allowlist
  const allowedHosts = ['api.trusted-domain.com', 'cdn.trusted-cdn.com'];
  const urlObj = new URL(url);

  if (!allowedHosts.includes(urlObj.hostname)) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized host access');
  }

  return fetch(url, options);
};
```

**Production Fix Strategy (T+1 day):**
1. **Version Analysis**: `bun pm info axios` - Found patched version
2. **Compatibility Testing**: Created staging environment
3. **Gradual Rollout**: 10% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% traffic
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time error rates and performance metrics

**Results:**
- **Zero data breaches** during mitigation period
- **Smooth production upgrade** with comprehensive testing
- **Enhanced security posture** with automated scanning
- **Improved response time** for future incidents

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **Regular audits are critical** - We now run daily security scans
2. **Have mitigation strategies ready** - Prepared fallbacks for common packages
3. **Test security fixes thoroughly** - Unexpected breaking changes happen
4. **Monitor post-deployment** - New versions can introduce performance regressions
